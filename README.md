# WatsonTcp

[![NuGet Version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/WatsonTcp.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WatsonTcp/) [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/WatsonTcp.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WatsonTcp) 

WatsonTcp is the fastest, easiest, most efficient way to build TCP-based clients and servers in C# with integrated framing, reliable transmission, and fast disconnect detection.

**IMPORTANT** WatsonTcp provides framing to ensure message-level delivery which also dictates that you must use WatsonTcp for both the server and the client.  If you need to integrate with a TCP client or server that isn't using WatsonTcp, please check out my other projects:
- CavemanTcp - TCP client and server without framing that allows you direct control over socket I/O - https://github.com/jchristn/cavemantcp
- SimpleTcp - TCP client and server without framing that sends received data to your application via callbacks - https://github.com/jchristn/simpletcp

## New in v4.1.12

- Fix for ClientMetadata.Dispose
- Security fix for JSON serializer

## Test Applications

Test projects for both client and server are included which will help you understand and exercise the class library.

## SSL

WatsonTcp supports data exchange with or without SSL.  The server and client classes include constructors that allow you to include fields for the PFX certificate file and password.  An example certificate can be found in the test projects, which has a password of 'password'.

## To Stream or Not To Stream...

WatsonTcp allows you to receive messages using either streams or byte arrays.  The ```MessageReceived``` event uses byte arrays and provides the easiest implementation, but the entire message payload is copied into memory, making it inefficient for larger messages.  For larger message sizes (generally measured in 10s or 100s of megabytes or beyond), it is **strongly** recommended that you use the ```StreamReceived``` event.  Only one of these methods can be assigned; you cannot use both.

When sending messages, the ```Send``` and ```SendAsync``` methods have both byte array and stream variants.  You are free to use whichever, or both, as you choose, regardless of whether you have implemented ```MessageReceived``` or ```StreamReceived```.

It is important to note that when using ```StreamReceived```, the socket is blocked until you have fully read the stream and control has returned from your consuming application back to WatsonTcp.  That's required, because otherwise, WatsonTcp would begin reading at the wrong place in the stream.  With ```MessageReceived```, WatsonTcp will fire the event and begin reading immediately, since the entirety of the message data has already been read from the stream by WatsonTcp.

Should you with to include a ```Dictionary<object, object>``` of metadata with any message, use the ```Send``` or ```SendAsync``` method that allows you to pass in metadata.  Refer to the ```TestClient```, ```TestServer```, ```TestClientStream```, and ```TestServerStream``` projects for a full example.

Please see below for examples with byte arrays and with streams.

## Running under Mono

.NET Core should always be the preferred option for multi-platform deployments.  However, WatsonTcp works well in Mono environments with the .NET Framework to the extent that we have tested it. It is recommended that when running under Mono, you execute the containing EXE using --server and after using the Mono Ahead-of-Time Compiler (AOT).  Note that TLS 1.2 is hard-coded, which may need to be downgraded to TLS in Mono environments.

NOTE: Windows accepts '0.0.0.0' as an IP address representing any interface.  On Mac and Linux you must be specified ('127.0.0.1' is also acceptable, but '0.0.0.0' is NOT).
```
mono --aot=nrgctx-trampolines=8096,nimt-trampolines=8096,ntrampolines=4048 --server myapp.exe
mono --server myapp.exe
```

## Examples

The following examples show a simple client and server example using WatsonTcp without SSL.

### Local vs External Connections

**IMPORTANT**
* If you specify ```127.0.0.1``` as the listener IP address in WatsonTcpServer, it will only be able to accept connections from within the local host.  
* To accept connections from other machines:
  * Use a specific interface IP address, or
  * Use ```null```, ```*```, ```+```, or ```0.0.0.0``` for the listener IP address (requires admin privileges to listen on any IP address)
* Make sure you create a permit rule on your firewall to allow inbound connections on that port
* If you use a port number under 1024, admin privileges will be required

### Server

Using byte arrays (```MessageReceived```)

```
using WatsonTcp;

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    WatsonTcpServer server = new WatsonTcpServer("127.0.0.1", 9000);
    server.ClientConnected += ClientConnected;
    server.ClientDisconnected += ClientDisconnected;
    server.MessageReceived += MessageReceived; 
    server.SyncRequestReceived = SyncRequestReceived;
    server.Start();

    // list clients
    IEnumerable<string> clients = server.ListClients();

    // send a message
    server.Send("[IP:port]", "Hello, client!");

    // send a message with metadata
    Dictionary<object, object> md = new Dictionary<object, object>();
    md.Add("foo", "bar");
    server.Send("[IP:port]", md, "Hello, client!  Here's some metadata!");

    // send async!
    await server.SendAsync("[IP:port", "Hello, client!  I'm async!");

    // send and wait for a response
    try
    {
        SyncResponse resp = server.SendAndWait("[IP:port", 5000, "Hey, say hello back within 5 seconds!");
        Console.WriteLine("My friend says: " + Encoding.UTF8.GetString(resp.Data));
    }
    catch (TimeoutException)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Too slow...");
    } 
}

static void ClientConnected(object sender, ClientConnectedEventArgs args)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Client connected: " + args.IpPort);
}

static void ClientDisconnected(object sender, ClientDisconnectedEventArgs args)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Client disconnected: " + args.IpPort + ": " + args.Reason.ToString());
}

static void MessageReceived(object sender, MessageReceivedFromClientEventArgs args)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Message received from " + args.IpPort + ": " + Encoding.UTF8.GetString(args.Data));
}

static SyncResponse SyncRequestReceived(SyncRequest req)
{
    return new SyncResponse("Hello back at you!");
}
```

### Client

Using byte arrays (```MessageReceived```)

```
using WatsonTcp;

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    WatsonTcpClient client = new WatsonTcpClient("127.0.0.1", 9000);
    client.ServerConnected += ServerConnected;
    client.ServerDisconnected += ServerDisconnected;
    client.MessageReceived += MessageReceived; 
    client.SyncRequestReceived = SyncRequestReceived;
    client.Start();

    // check connectivity
    Console.WriteLine("Am I connected?  " + client.Connected);

    // send a message
    client.Send("Hello!");

    // send a message with metadata
    Dictionary<object, object> md = new Dictionary<object, object>();
    md.Add("foo", "bar");
    client.Send(md, "Hello, client!  Here's some metadata!");

    // send async!
    await client.SendAsync("Hello, client!  I'm async!");

    // send and wait for a response
    try
    {
        SyncResponse resp = client.SendAndWait(5000, "Hey, say hello back within 5 seconds!");
        Console.WriteLine("My friend says: " + Encoding.UTF8.GetString(resp.Data));
    }
    catch (TimeoutException)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Too slow...");
    }  
}

static void MessageReceived(object sender, MessageReceivedFromServerEventArgs args)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Message from server: " + Encoding.UTF8.GetString(args.Data));
}

static void ServerConnected(object sender, EventArgs args)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Server connected");
}

static void ServerDisconnected(object sender, EventArgs args)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Server disconnected");
}

static SyncResponse SyncRequestReceived(SyncRequest req)
{
    return new SyncResponse("Hello back at you!");
}
```

## Example with SSL

The examples above can be modified to use SSL as follows.  No other changes are needed.  Ensure that the certificate is exported as a PFX file and is resident in the directory of execution.
```
// server
WatsonTcpServer server = new WatsonTcpSslServer("127.0.0.1", 9000, "test.pfx", "password");
server.ClientConnected += ClientConnected;
server.ClientDisconnected += ClientDisconnected;
server.MessageReceived += MessageReceived;
server.AcceptInvalidCertificates = true;
server.MutuallyAuthenticate = true;
server.Start();

// client
WatsonTcpClient client = new WatsonTcpClient("127.0.0.1", 9000, "test.pfx", "password");
client.ServerConnected += ServerConnected;
client.ServerDisconnected += ServerDisconnected;
client.MessageReceived += MessageReceived;
client.AcceptInvalidCertificates = true;
client.MutuallyAuthenticate = true;
client.Start();
```

## Example with Streams

Refer to the ```TestClientStream``` and ```TestServerStream``` projects for a full example.  
```
// server
WatsonTcpServer server = new WatsonTcpSslServer("127.0.0.1", 9000);
server.ClientConnected += ClientConnected;
server.ClientDisconnected += ClientDisconnected;
server.StreamReceived += StreamReceived; 
server.Start();

static void StreamReceived(object sender, StreamReceivedFromClientEventArgs args)
{
    // read args.ContentLength bytes from args.DataStream and process
}

// client
WatsonTcpClient client = new WatsonTcpClient("127.0.0.1", 9000);
client.ServerConnected += ServerConnected;
client.ServerDisconnected += ServerDisconnected;
client.StreamReceived += StreamReceived; 
client.Start();

static void StreamReceived(object sender, StreamReceivedFromServerEventArgs args)
{
    // read args.ContentLength bytes from args.DataStream and process
}
```

## Compression

Data compression was added in v4.1.0 to reduce bandwidth consumption for data send between client and server (thank you @developervariety for the suggestion).  Compression is applied only to the data and not to the headers or user-supplied metadata, because we wanted to keep framing simple to support external integration with Watson.  Please refer to *FRAMING.md* for details.

Compression is enabled as a property on either client or server, and this will instruct the instance to send message data using the specified compression method.  Compressed messages are automatically decompressed on the receiving side without any configuration required.  

The ```Compression``` property can be set to one of: ```Gzip```, ```Deflate```, ```None```.

```
using WatsonTcp;

using (WatsonTcpServer server = new WatsonTcpServer("127.0.0.1", 8000))
{
    using (WatsonTcpClient client = new WatsonTcpClient("127.0.0.1", 8000))
    {
        server.MessageReceived += ServerMessageReceived;
        server.Compression = CompressionType.Gzip;      // all message data sent from server now Gzip compressed
        server.Start();

        client.MessageReceived += ClientMessageReceived;
        client.Compression = CompressionType.None;      // client will not compress data it sends
        client.Start();
    }
}
```

## Disconnection Handling

The project TcpTest (https://github.com/jchristn/TcpTest) was built specifically to provide a reference for WatsonTcp to handle a variety of disconnection scenarios.  These include:

| Test case | Description | Pass/Fail |
|---|---|---|
| Server-side dispose | Graceful termination of all client connections | PASS |
| Server-side client removal | Graceful termination of a single client | PASS |
| Server-side termination | Abrupt termination due to process abort or CTRL-C | PASS |
| Client-side dispose | Graceful termination of a client connection | PASS |
| Client-side termination | Abrupt termination due to a process abort or CTRL-C | PASS |

## Disconnecting Idle Clients

If you wish to have WatsonTcpServer automatically disconnect clients that have been idle for a period of time, set ```WatsonTcpServer.IdleClientTimeoutSeconds``` to a positive integer.  Receiving a message from a client automatically resets their timeout.  Client timeouts are evaluated every 5 seconds by Watson, so the disconnection may not be precise (for instance, if you use 7 seconds as your disconnect interval).

## Version History

Please refer to CHANGELOG.md for details.
